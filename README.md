## Code review by Viktor Sjöblom
1. When registing a new account and logging in, the password is shown when you write it. Might be a good idea to hide this?
2. There is a very distinct orange color popping up when clicking on buttons. This can be disabled with the “.outline: none;”-command in your CSS!
3. You can avoid the page reloading when liking a picture by using JavaScript Fetch.
4. The buttons on edit profile gets pretty big in desktop-mode. Might be intentional?
5. I think the “+”-sign in the footer for uploading images might be a bit too subtile. (Probably just a matter of taste.)
6. Great job previewing the image you are about to upload!
7. You make good use of @param in functions which makes it easy to understand what your functions do.
8. One thing to think about in the future is that you divide your JavaScript into more than one document. 
9. I like the way you comment your code. In my opinion it’s just the correct amount!
10. I think you’ve done a very good job in this project and your code is easy to read and neatly organised. Great job Terese!
